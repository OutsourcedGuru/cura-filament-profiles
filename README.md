# cura-filament-profiles
A collection of custom material profiles ready to be imported into Cura.

[Cura](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura) has a feature which allows you to create custom material profiles for the filaments you have purchased.  Here, I'm sharing the custom profiles which I've created for the filaments as I purchase and then use them in my own projects.  Importing the profile may be easily done from Cura's settings menu area under Materials.

Having imported the necessary profiles, they may be selected from the Material pull-down list by manufacturer and name.  This should pull in the temperature settings as discovered from the documentation per each filament plus experimentation in some cases.

Clicking on the image below should begin the download process for the underlying file.  Save it to your computer and then import it from Cura's settings option.
